prerequisites:
- A set of allele sequences, named, gapped sequences for V alleles
- For those sequences that are genomically backed, repository accession numbers, and coordinates of each sequence in one or more of the genbank entries
- Genbank records are strongly preferred, as they can be checked by the code and links provided in OGRDB

steps:
- populate a copy of sequence_evidence_blank.csv with details of all genomic evidence:
   - each row lists one piece of evidence for one allele
   - multiple pieces of evidence (multiple genbank records) may be provided for an allele, on multiple rows 
   - 'gene_label' is the assigned name of the allele
   - 'sequence' is the sequence of the annotated sequence in 5' to 3' orientation, including all annotated features
   - 'sequence_type' is V, D, J or C
   - 'repository' must be 'Genbank' for Genbank, or another repository designation
   - 'accession' is the accession id in the repository
   - 'patch' is the patch level in the repository
   - 'sense' must be + if the sequence in the repository is in 5' to 3' annotation and - otherwise
   - 'species_subgroup' and 'subgroup_type' must be completed with the designated values agreed for this strain or breed, or left blank if none have been agreed.
     These are only used in cases where records for multiple strains, breeds etc are anticipated.
   - 'start' and 'end' denote the location of the entire annotated sequence in the genbank record. They, and all feature coordinates:
     must follow the following conventions:
        - all coordinates must be given in 1-based inclusive form
        - coordinates start and end must denote the location of the annotated sequence or feature in the genbank record. The coordinates must be 
            the actual coordinates of the sequence in the orientatation of the sequence found in genbank, and start must be < end 
            regardless of orientation
   - 'gene_start', 'gene_end' denote the start and end of the core coding sequence of the gene (eg V-REGION). They must be included.
   - all other annotated features should be included
   - for J-genes, j_cdr3_end should be the index of the end of the CDR3 region, normally indicated byt the [WF]G.G motif. The receptor_utils
     annotate_j tool can be used to determine this.

- run check_evidence.py to verify the evidence file. For Genbank records, the script can download records from Genbank for checking. In other cases,
  the genomic evidence must be downloaded from the repository into files named after the accession id.

- fix any errors reported and move on to the next step once all errors are fixed.

- populate a copy of sequence_upload_blank.csv with a list of the alleles to be uploaded to OGRDB. All alleles to be uploaded must be included
  and there should only be one line in the file for each allele.
  - 'gene_label' is the assigned name of the allele
  - 'imgt' is the IUIS name of the allele if one has been issued 
  - 'functional' is F, ORF or P, using the Digger definition of F. If this has not been determined, use ORF if the core coding sequence does not contain stop codons,
     F otherwise
  - 'type' <locus><type> where <locus> is IGH, IGK, IGL, TRA, TRB, TRD or TRG and <type> is V, D, J or C
  - 'inference_type' is 'Unrearranged, 'Unrearranged and rearranged', or 'Rearranged Only'. Genomic evidence must be provided in the evidence file for all alleles in the 
    first two categories.
  - 'sequence' is the sequence of the annotated sequence in 5' to 3' orientation, including all annotated features
  - 'sequence_gapped' is the IMGT-gapped V-REGION for V genes, and blank otherwise.
  - 'species_subgroup' and 'subgroup_type' must be completed with the designated values agreed for this strain or breed, or left blank if none have been agreed.
  - 'alt_names' is a comma-separated list of any other names by which this allele sequence has been known in the past which are worth mentioning
  - 'affirmation' should be 1
  - 'chromosome' should be the chromosome number or other identifier for this locus
  - 'paralogs' should list any other sequences in the reference set which have an identical core coding region
  - when paralogs are listed, 'varb_rep' must list the gene_label of the single allele in the set of paralogs that should be listed in non-abmiguous reference sets,
    otherwise it should be blank.
  - 'notes' should list any notes on functionality
  - 'inferred_ext', 'ext_3_prime' and 'ext_5_prime' are generally not used - they allow the submission to indicate that the provided sequence of a V allele has been
    extended without conclusive evidence by homology with other alleles of the gene. Under normal circumstances they should be left blank.
  - 'curational_tags' are used in some circumstances with inferred repertoires. Permitted values are 'likely_truncated' and 'likely_full_length'. In other
    circumstances the field should be blank.
  - 'mapped' should be Y if the sequence is supported by genomic evidence that is sufficient to localise the gene within the locus, otherwise blank.

  - Remaining fields in the file denote coordinates of the features in the sequence provided in the 'sequence' column. These will be determined by populate_upload.py,
    either from the evidence file or, for rearranged inferences, from sequence data in the upload file. In this latter case, for V and D genes, 'sequence' 
    will simply be the sequence of the core coding region, and 'gene_start' will be 1, and 'gene_end' will equate to the length of 'sequence'. 
  - for J-genes, where genomic evidence does not exist, j_cdr3_end should be the index of the end of the CDR3 region, normally indicated byt the [WF]G.G motif. The receptor_utils
    annotate_j tool can be used to determine this.
